# MirrorNet

**MirrorNet** is a **Decentralized, Encrypted, P2P Backup System** built in **Go**. It lets users securely back up data across a network of trusted peers without relying on centralized servers, all encrypted, all verifiable, all yours.

## Why MirrorNet?

Modern cloud storage is convenient â€” but centralization puts privacy and durability at risk. MirrorNet flips the script:

- **End-to-End Encryption** - Your files, your keys.
- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture** - Redundant, distributed backups.
- **Self-Healing** - Peers detect and repair missing chunks.
- **Modular Design** - Easily extend storage, networking, and crypto layers.
